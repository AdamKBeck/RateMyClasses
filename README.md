# RateMyClasses
The Rate My Classes System is a crowd-sourced course rating and review System for university classes, beginning with those at Case Western Reserve University.

Contributors will be able to anonymously rate class based on several criteria, such as class difficulty, workload, and whether or not a class is more challenging with certain professors. Contributors can also list additional information about a class such as whether or not they recommend taking the class and other classes that helped prepare them for this class. All this information will be available upon searching for a class by either its name or the abbreviated department name and class number. Users can scroll through the list of classes and get first hand review and suggestions from Contributors that have already taken classes at Case Western Reserve University.
